## Troubleshooting

**Extension not working?**

- Make sure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`.
- Try refreshing the page.

**Dashes not highlighting?**
- Ensure the text contains actual en dashes (‚Äì) or em dashes (‚Äî), not regular hyphens (-).
- The extension only processes visible text content.
- The extension does not highlight dashes in edit mode (i.e. when you are editing a page or adding a comment).
- Verify that highlighting is enabled for the dash type in the extension options.

**Performance issues?**
- The extension is optimized for performance, but very large pages might see slight delays.
